Background
::::::::::

Genome-wide microarray data remains one of most widely used methods to obtain genotypic information on collected DNA samples, despite the 
growing popularity and accessibility of genotyping by sequencing.
To make a comprehensive genomic pipeline, 
we wanted to provide the means necessary for researchers to still access such a large body of data that remains important for many analyses. 
``GWAS data`` can be used in many more applications than gene identification, such as ancestry estimation,
historical population reconstruction, clinical genetic testing for diagnostic purposes, forensic analyses, new method validation for sequencing data. 

This module is currently limited to Illumina_ microarrays on the basis of the software tools and support and product file downloads.
It is configured to the MEGA_ microarray, meaning download files are pointed to MEGA support files and product files.
It does possess the capability to be adapted to other microarrays. Pull requests and collobarations are welcomed.
